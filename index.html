  <em>Orbital Skyhooks is the concept of a space transportation system which aims to reduce the cost and energy needed to launch payloads into orbit. Unlike a traditional rocket, which uses chemical propulsion, a skyhook would use a rotating tether which would be situated in low Earth orbit to transfer momentum to a spacecraft, which results in throwing them into higher orbits. This article will explore how an orbital skyhook could work, the physical principles behind momentum exchange, and why it would act as a stepping stone towards more advanced space infrastructure such as a space elevator. The pros of skyhooks include reduced fuel consumption, cheaper launch costs and lessened environmental impact. However, there are some important challenges we will need to find solutions for, which include and not limited to, material strength, orbital stability and construction stability. Current research and small-scale experimental studies are talked about to assess whether skyhooks are feasible for the future and whether or not they would be practical.</em>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Access to space right now depends almost entirely on chemical rocket launches. While it has been effective, it is also requires a large amount of energy and is expensive, especially when it comes to launching payloads into low Earth orbit and beyond. As we aim to get more involved in space, which involves satellite deployment and scientific missions, there has been a growing interest in different way we could launch these payloads to reduce the limitations chemical propulsion currently has. Traditional rockets also have the drawback of not being eco-friendly due to the large fuel consumption and exhaust emmissions, which further emphasise the need for alternative launch systems. 
One idea is the orbital skyhook, which uses a tether to exchange momentum to help a spacecraft or payload gain orbital energy without relying on onboard propulsion.  Instead of using fuel to propel the spacecraft into a higher orbit, a skyhook would transfer the energy mechanically with the use of a rotating tether placed in orbit. Although this concept has existed for a few decades, it is still largely theoretical and presents a number of technical problems that have made it difficult to achieve. 
This article will explore the concept of an orbital skyhook by outlining how it would work and the physical principles it relies on. We will also consider the main limitations affecting the system such as material constraints and how stable a sky hook would be in orbit, so we can find out whether or not skyhooks are viable in the future.</em></p>
