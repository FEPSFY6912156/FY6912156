  <em>Orbital Skyhooks is the concept of a space transportation system which aims to reduce the cost and energy needed to launch payloads into orbit. Unlike a traditional rocket, which uses chemical propulsion, a skyhook would use a rotating tether which would be situated in low Earth orbit to transfer momentum to a spacecraft, which results in throwing them into higher orbits. This article will explore how an orbital skyhook could work, the physical principles behind momentum exchange, and why it would act as a stepping stone towards more advanced space infrastructure such as a space elevator. The pros of skyhooks include reduced fuel consumption, cheaper launch costs and lessened environmental impact. However, there are some important challenges we will need to find solutions for, which include and not limited to, material strength, orbital stability and construction stability. Current research and small-scale experimental studies are talked about to assess whether skyhooks are feasible for the future and whether or not they would be practical.</em>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Access to space today is mainly facilitated through chemical rocket propulsion. While it is very effective, it is very energy-intensive and expensive in regard to payload delivery to low Earth orbit and beyond. With increasing satellite deployments and scientific missions, there has been increased interest in other means of deploying payloads as ways of mitigating inherent drawbacks associated with chemical propulsion. Traditional rockets also have their own environmental drawbacks, since they consume a large amount of fuel and produce fumes in the exhaust, hence the need for non-chemical launching systems.</p>
<p>One of the current concepts considered would be something called a skyhook. In it, a tether is employed to allow the spacecraft or payload to gather orbital energy without having propulsion to be carried onboard. Rather than using propellant to climb to a higher orbit, a skyhook would carry out the energy transfer mechanically through a rotating tether in orbit. Although some discussion of the concept has been going on for many years, it is still highly theoretical and includes several problems.</p>
<p>The orbital skyhook is described in this paper by explaining its working mechanism and the physical principles it is based upon. It also takes into account some of the most important limitations that affect the system, such as material constraints and orbital stability, regarding the potential viability for future applications.</p>
