  <em>Orbital Skyhooks is the concept of a space transportation system which aims to reduce the cost and energy needed to launch payloads into orbit. Unlike a traditional rocket, which uses chemical propulsion, a skyhook would use a rotating tether which would be situated in low Earth orbit to transfer momentum to a spacecraft, which results in throwing them into higher orbits. This article will explore how an orbital skyhook could work, the physical principles behind momentum exchange, and why it would act as a stepping stone towards more advanced space infrastructure such as a space elevator. The pros of skyhooks include reduced fuel consumption, cheaper launch costs and lessened environmental impact. However, there are some important challenges we will need to find solutions for, which include and not limited to, material strength, orbital stability and construction stability. Current research and small-scale experimental studies are talked about to assess whether skyhooks are feasible for the future and whether or not they would be practical.</em>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Access to space today is primarily facilitated through chemical rocket propulsion. It is very effective, but very energy intensive and costly for payload delivery, especially up to low Earth orbit and beyond. With the increase of satellite deployments and scientific missions, interest has been growing in other ways of deploying payloads as ways of mitigating inherent drawbacks with chemical propulsion. Traditional rockets also have their own environmental drawbacks because they consume a large amount of fuel and produce exhaust fumes, hence the increasing need for non-chemical launching systems.</p>
<p>One concept currently being considered is something known as a skyhook. A tether is utilized to allow a spacecraft or payload to gain orbital energy without requiring propulsion to be carried onboard. Instead of using propellant to climb to a higher orbit, a skyhook would perform the energy transfer mechanically by means of a rotating tether in orbit. While the idea has been discussed for many years, it is still largely theoretical and involves several problems.</p>
<p>The idea of the orbital skyhook is discussed in this paper by describing the working mechanism and the physical principles on which it is based. It will also consider the principal limitations affecting the system, including material constraints and orbital stability, in order to assess its potential viability for future applications.</p>
