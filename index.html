<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>
  <em>Skyhooks are the concept of a space transportation system which aims to reduce the cost and energy needed to launch payloads into orbit. Unlike a traditional rocket, which uses chemical propulsion, a skyhook would use a rotating tether which would be situated in low Earth orbit to transfer momentum to a spacecraft, which results in throwing them into higher orbits. This article explores how a skyhook could work, the physical principles behind momentum exchange and why it would act as a stepping stone towards more advanced space infrastructure. The advantages of skyhooks include reduced fuel consumption, cheaper launch costs and lessened environmental impact. However, there are some important challenges, which include and not limited to, material strength, orbital and construction stability. Current research and small-scale experimental studies are used to assess whether skyhooks are feasible for the future and whether they would be practical. (Chen et al., 2013; Penzo, 1989) </em>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Access to space today is mainly facilitated through chemical rocket propulsion. While it is very effective, it is very energy-intensive and expensive in regard to payload delivery to low Earth orbit and beyond. With increasing satellite deployments and scientific missions, there has been increased interest in other means of deploying payloads as ways of mitigating inherent drawbacks associated with chemical propulsion. Traditional rockets also have their own environmental drawbacks, since they consume a large amount of fuel and produce fumes in the exhaust, hence the need for non-chemical launching systems. (NASA, 2019)</p>
<p>One of the current concepts considered would be something called a skyhook. In it, a tether is employed to allow the spacecraft or payload to gather orbital energy without having propulsion to be carried onboard. Rather than using propellant to climb to a higher orbit, a skyhook would carry out the energy transfer mechanically through a rotating tether in orbit. Although some discussion of the concept has been going on for many years, it is still highly theoretical and includes several problems. (Chen et al., 2013; Zubrin, 1995)</p>
<p>The orbital skyhook is described in this paper by explaining its working mechanism and the physical principles it is based upon. It also takes into account some of the most important limitations that affect the system, such as material constraints and orbital stability, regarding the potential viability for future applications. </p>

</p>
<p><em>In an orbital skyhook, the lifting of a spacecraft's orbit is achieved by momentum exchange rather than by chemical propulsion. A long tether in low Earth orbit rotates about its centre of mass while it orbits the Earth; as it does, one end of the tether periodically falls closer to the Earth's surface while the other rises to a higher altitude. A spacecraft can rendezvous with the lower end of the tether at a precisely calculated moment, at which time it will be able to attach while the tether is moving in a different velocity relative to the Earth. This transfers momentum from the rotating tether to the attached spacecraft, increasing the speed of the latter and enabling it to be released into a much higher orbit without any need for large quantities of onboard fuel. There is of course a slight loss of rotational energy in the skyhook during such a maneuver, but this can be partly regained by transferring returning spacecraft from the higher orbit, slowing them down by capture with the tether, and then releasing them again. It is in this way that, over time, incoming and outgoing spacecraft can help balance the system and reduce the need for continuous propulsion. The effectiveness of the skyhook depends on the tangential velocity of the tether tip, which is related to its angular velocity and length by the relationship v = ωr, where v represents the tangential speed of the tether tip, ω is the angular velocity, and r is the distance from the centre of mass. Increasing either the tether length or its rotational speed increases the velocity difference available for momentum transfer. A skyhook depends for its operation on the principle of conservation of momentum and upon orbital mechanics; although it avoids some of the really extreme material demands of the space elevator concept, it still requires very precise timing, strong materials, and very stable orbital dynamics if it is to operate safely. (Penzo, 1989)</em></p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p><em>One of the key benefits of an orbital skyhook is it reduces the fuel required to be taken up to higher orbits. Because the system relies on momentum exchange, rather than chemical propulsion, no onboard fuel needs to be carried by spacecraft. This can greatly reduce launch mass and overall mission cost. This will reduce the environmental impact associated with rocket launches, since fewer launches or smaller rockets may be needed. Another advantage a skyhook has is that it is a reusable structure, staying in orbit; while most of the traditional rockets tend to be single-use. With time passing, this can make access to space far more efficient and economically viable. In addition, skyhooks could support more frequent launches and enable large-scale space operations such as satellite deployment and resupply missions by providing a consistent method for transferring spacecraft to higher orbits. (Zubrin, 1995; NASA, 2007)</em></p>

</p>
<p><em>One of the main challenges for skyhooks is that the material that a sky hook would need, would have to be very strong yet very light. The tether has to bear great tensile stresses due to its rotation and the momentum transfer between spacecraft, hence putting great demands on material strength and durability. It follows from the relationship between tangential velocity, angular velocity, and radius that increasing either the length or rotational speed of the tether would benefit the performance, but both of these increases are severely limited by material constraints and structural stability. Another problem is the need for precise orbital control and timing, since docking with the tether requires very accurate positioning and matching velocities. The skyhook would also be vulnerable to space debris, which could easily compromise the integrity of the tether. Furthermore, constructing and deploying a rotating structure of this size in orbit would be complex and expensive, requiring advanced robotics and assembly techniques. Though the concept of a skyhook is possible in physical terms, a great deal of technological development remains before it could be safely and reliably implemented. (Penzo, 1989; ESA, 2021)</em></p>

<h2 id="feasibility">Feasibility and current research</h2>
<p><em>The research into orbital skyhooks has been largely theoretical, consisting of feasibility modelling and simulation rather than full-scale testing. Early studies concentrated on whether it was feasible for momentum-exchange tethers to transfer energy into spacecraft without excessively large propulsion requirements. More recent work has concentrated on material limitations and orbital stability. Carbon nanotube composites, Zylon (PBO fibre), and other high-strength polymer fibres have been investigated because of their high tensile strength-to-weight ratios. Advances in materials science have made these options more promising than in the past; however, current materials are still insufficient in terms of strength, durability, and damage tolerance for large-scale skyhook systems. Small-scale tethers deployed in low Earth orbit show that deployment and control of tethers is possible, (NASA, 2007), and deliver valuable data for future designs. Despite these advances, massive challenges exist in terms of long-term material degradation, space debris vulnerability, and safe operational control. Consequently, orbital skyhooks will not be feasible anytime soon, but ongoing improvements in materials and orbital engineering could make them more realistic over time. (Chen et al., 2013; Bangham, 1998)</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>In summary, orbital skyhooks are a theoretically valid approach to reducing energy and fuel required for launching spacecraft into higher orbits by relying on momentum exchange instead of chemical propulsion. The concept has an evident capability to facilitate lower fuel requirements, reusable systems, and lower environmental impact than the conventional rocket-based launches. However, although the concept is theoretically sound, there are still several significant problems. Material strength limits, long-term orbital stability considerations, and space debris along with operational complexity issues are significant obstacles. From the current research, although small-scale tethers are feasible, the technology required for the full-scale orbital skyhook has not yet been adequately developed. With enhanced material science and space engineering, orbital skyhooks may be considered feasible in the future, but at the present point, they are a long-term rather than a practical concept for routine space transportation.
